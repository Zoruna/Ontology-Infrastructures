# Ontology Infrastructures | Logical Architecture Proof-of-Concept

This repository is a **technical experiment** in translating philosophical tensions into machine-readable knowledge structures. As a **Student of Information Philosophy**, I am exploring how to formalize the "logic of operation" for the next era of AI.

## The Challenge: Leibniz vs. Nietzsche
In my research, I identify a fundamental tension between:
1. **Leibnizian Compossibility:** The logical requirement for structural consistency and non-contradiction.
2. **Nietzschean Becoming:** The dynamic flow of power and agency that resists static definitions.

## Knowledge Graph Strategy (GraphRAG Ready)
The `ontology.jsonld` file provided here is a semantic map of the **Principle of Operational Sufficiency (PSO)**. 
- It treats **Becoming** as the driver of agency (Teleonomy).
- It treats **Compossibility** as the boundary for stability (Systems Theory).

By structuring these concepts as **Linked Data**, we enable AI models to perform **Logical Auditing** via GraphRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), allowing an LLM to "understand" the constraints of a system before execution.

## Applications
* **Semantic Web:** Standardizing terms for the Infosphere (as proposed by Luciano Floridi).
* **Agentic AI:** Providing a logical "World Model" for autonomous agents to evaluate their own operational sufficiency.
